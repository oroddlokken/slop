"""Which project a usage record belongs to — one definition, for every reader.

Three answers used to coexist (macsetup-2qrp): a path prefix under the
projects dir, a cwd's basename, and ccreport's override table. Only the third
knew about `ccreport merge`, so a merge regrouped the reports and left the
statusline's per-project cost windows split. Everything that needs a project
name now resolves it here, and pricing.py layers the directory scoping on top.

cache_db is imported inside the function rather than at module level: cache_db
imports pricing and pricing imports this module, so a top-level import would
close the loop before any of the three finished initialising.
